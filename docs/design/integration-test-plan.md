# Integration test plan

## Status

Implemented

## Context

The current integration tests only cover end-to-end telemetry: install packages, start an app, send traffic, and check that traces appear.
This leaves large gaps in coverage around package metadata, lifecycle events, configuration behavior, and vendor replacement.

This document defines the full matrix of tests needed and the implementation approach.

## Test categories

### 1. Package metadata validation

Validate that built packages declare the correct metadata fields without starting any containers or installing anything.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| Injector provides `opentelemetry-injector1` | Virtual package for interface versioning |
| Java provides `opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation1` | Virtual package for vendor replacement |
| Node.js provides `opentelemetry-nodejs-autoinstrumentation1` | Virtual package for vendor replacement |
| .NET provides `opentelemetry-dotnet-autoinstrumentation1` | Virtual package for vendor replacement |
| Python provides `opentelemetry-python-autoinstrumentation1` | Virtual package for vendor replacement |
| Ruby provides `opentelemetry-ruby-autoinstrumentation1` | Virtual package for vendor replacement |
| Metapackage depends on `opentelemetry-injector1` | Not a concrete package name |
| Metapackage depends on `opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation1` | Not a concrete package name |
| Metapackage depends on `opentelemetry-nodejs-autoinstrumentation1` | Not a concrete package name |
| Metapackage depends on `opentelemetry-dotnet-autoinstrumentation1` | Not a concrete package name |
| Injector suggests `opentelemetry-injector1` on Java/Node.js/.NET packages (DEB) | Soft dependency |
| No `sed` or `grep` dependencies on injector | Scripts use only POSIX builtins |

**Implementation:** Parse the built package files natively in Go with `pault.ag/go/debian` and `cavaliergopher/rpm` (no `dpkg-deb` or `rpm` CLI tools).
No containers needed — these are host-side assertions on the `.deb`/`.rpm` artifacts.

### 2. Package contents validation

Validate that packages contain the expected files at the expected paths with correct permissions.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| Injector contains `libotelinject.so` at `/usr/lib/opentelemetry/injector/` | Binary placement |
| Injector contains `injector.conf` at `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/` | Config placement |
| Injector contains `default_env.conf` at `/etc/opentelemetry/injector/` | Env config placement |
| Injector contains empty `conf.d/` directory | Drop-in directory |
| Java contains `opentelemetry-javaagent.jar` | Agent placement |
| Java contains `conf.d/java.conf` with correct path | Drop-in references correct JAR |
| Node.js contains `register.js` in node_modules tree | Agent placement |
| Node.js contains `conf.d/nodejs.conf` with correct path | Drop-in references correct entry point |
| .NET contains native profiler for glibc and musl | Both libc flavors |
| .NET contains `conf.d/dotnet.conf` with correct path prefix | Drop-in references correct prefix |
| Python contains its glibc bundle and `conf.d/python.conf` | Bundle and injector path prefix |
| Ruby contains its glibc gem bundle, fixed entry point, and `conf.d/ruby.conf` | Bundle and injector path prefix |
| Man pages are present and gzipped | Documentation |

**Implementation:** List package contents natively in Go with `pault.ag/go/debian` and `cavaliergopher/rpm` (no `dpkg-deb` or `rpm` CLI tools).
No containers needed.

### 3. Post-install / pre-uninstall scripts

Validate that the injector's lifecycle scripts correctly manage `/etc/ld.so.preload`.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| Install creates `/etc/ld.so.preload` with injector path | Post-install |
| Install is idempotent (second install doesn't duplicate the entry) | Post-install idempotency |
| Remove cleans up the injector path from `/etc/ld.so.preload` | Pre-uninstall |
| Remove deletes `/etc/ld.so.preload` if it becomes empty | Cleanup |
| Remove preserves other entries in `/etc/ld.so.preload` | Non-destructive |

**Implementation:** Install/remove the injector package in a container and inspect `/etc/ld.so.preload` at each stage.
Implemented in `packaging/tests/lifecycle/preload_test.go`.

### 4. Config file lifecycle

Validate that configuration files are handled correctly across package lifecycle events.

#### 4a. Config file preservation on remove (DEB)

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `apt remove opentelemetry-injector` preserves `injector.conf` | Conffiles kept on remove |
| `apt remove opentelemetry-injector` preserves `default_env.conf` | Conffiles kept on remove |
| `apt purge opentelemetry-injector` removes config files | Conffiles deleted on purge |

#### 4b. Config file behavior on upgrade

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| Upgrade with unmodified config: new config replaces old | Standard upgrade |
| Upgrade with user-modified config: user changes preserved (DEB prompts, RPM creates `.rpmnew`) | Modified conffile handling |

#### 4c. Config file behavior with user overrides

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| User adds `99-custom.conf` in `conf.d/`: injector reads it | Custom drop-in |
| User modifies `default_env.conf` to set `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`: value is applied | Env var override |
| User modifies `default_env.conf`: package upgrade preserves the modification | Modified conffile on upgrade |

**Implementation:** Install packages, modify config files, upgrade/remove, and assert on file state and application behavior.
Implemented in `packaging/tests/lifecycle/config_test.go`.
The RPM equivalents of 4a (unmodified configs removed, modified configs saved as `.rpmsave`) are covered there as well.
The runtime rows of 4c (the injector applying `default_env.conf` values and `conf.d/` drop-ins) are behavioral coverage the E2E telemetry suites already provide.

### 5. Install scenarios (beyond metapackage)

Validate that individual packages and combinations install correctly via `apt`/`dnf`.

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `apt install opentelemetry` | Metapackage pulls in everything |
| `apt install opentelemetry-injector` | Injector alone, no language packages |
| `apt install opentelemetry-injector opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation` | Injector + single language |
| `apt install opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation` (without injector) | Language package alone (Suggests, not Depends) |
| `apt remove opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation` | Removing one language doesn't remove injector |
| `apt remove opentelemetry-injector` | Removing injector doesn't force-remove language packages |

Removing the injector does remove the `opentelemetry` metapackage, which hard-depends on it; the language packages stay installed.

**Implementation:** Run `apt install`/`apt remove` sequences in containers and verify package state with `dpkg -l`.
Implemented in `packaging/tests/lifecycle/install_test.go`, for Python as well.

### 6. Vendor replacement

Validate the vendor override mechanism end-to-end using a mock `acme-java-autoinstrumentation` package.

#### 6a. Build the mock vendor package

Build an `acme-java-autoinstrumentation` package that:
- `Provides: opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation1`
- `Conflicts: opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation`
- `Replaces: opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation`
- Installs a different JAR at the same path
- Installs its own `conf.d/java.conf` pointing to the different JAR

#### 6b. Vendor replacement tests

| Test | What it validates |
|------|-------------------|
| Fresh install: `apt install opentelemetry acme-java-autoinstrumentation` | Vendor package satisfies metapackage dependency |
| Swap: `apt install acme-java-autoinstrumentation` on existing system | Upstream Java replaced, metapackage stays |
| Revert: `apt install opentelemetry-java-autoinstrumentation` after vendor | Vendor removed, upstream restored |
| Upstream `conf.d/java.conf` is replaced by vendor's, not duplicated | File ownership transfer |
| Metapackage remains installed throughout swap and revert | Dependency resolution |
| `apt install opentelemetry` with both upstream and vendor repositories enabled | Two providers of the same virtual never coexist |

**Implementation:** Build a mock vendor package as part of the test setup, then run install/swap/revert sequences in containers.
Implemented in `packaging/tests/vendor/vendor_test.go`; the mock package is built by `packaging/tests/vendor/mkvendor`.

### 7. E2E telemetry (existing, expanded)

Implemented for Java, Node.js, .NET, Python, and Ruby across DEB and RPM.
The Ruby scenario starts an application with no OpenTelemetry dependency in its Gemfile and asserts that injector-activated instrumentation exports an OTLP client span.

### 8. Declarative configuration E2E

One scenario per language (`Test<Lang>DeclarativeConfiguration`, DEB and one base image only — the configuration-file mechanism does not vary with the packaging format):
the workload container sets `OTEL_CONFIG_FILE` to the shipped `/etc/opentelemetry/<language>/otel-config.yaml` (plus `OTEL_EXPERIMENTAL_FILE_BASED_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=true` for .NET), and the test asserts traces arrive at the sink.
This proves the whole declarative chain: the shipped file is valid, the `${VAR}` interpolations pick up the endpoint, service name, and resource attributes the injector injects (the sink's per-test `test.id` arrives via `attributes_list`), and each agent's file configurator activates — including sitecustomize.py's `otel-config-check` validation for Python and the `startNodeSDK` routing in the Node.js `register.js` wrapper.
Declarative runs assert traces only: under `OTEL_CONFIG_FILE` the SDKs ignore the env-var schedule tuning the images set, so metrics follow the default 60-second cadence.
The scenarios run inside the `integration-test-deb-<language>` targets.

## Test infrastructure

### Package metadata and contents tests

These run on the host against built artifacts — no containers needed.
New test file: `packaging/tests/metadata/metadata_test.go`.

### Lifecycle and install scenario tests

These need a base container with the local repo configured.
The test execs `apt`/`dnf` commands and inspects state.
These tests share a common Dockerfile per format (DEB/RPM) that just sets up the repos — no application runtime needed.
The images are hermetic (distro repositories removed), which the packages' absence of external dependencies allows; runtime installs never touch the network.
Each scenario runs in a fresh container because every scenario mutates global system state; the image is built once per format and shared across the scenario containers.

### Vendor replacement tests

These need a build step for the mock `acme-*` package (`packaging/tests/vendor/mkvendor`), then use the same lifecycle container pattern.

## Makefile targets

```
make integration-tests                    # all tests
make integration-test-metadata            # package metadata + contents
make integration-test-deb-java            # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-deb-nodejs          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-deb-dotnet          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-deb-python          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-deb-ruby            # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-rpm-java            # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-rpm-nodejs          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-rpm-dotnet          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-rpm-python          # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-rpm-ruby            # E2E telemetry
make integration-test-deb-lifecycle       # DEB install/remove/upgrade/config
make integration-test-rpm-lifecycle       # RPM install/remove/upgrade/config
make integration-test-deb-vendor          # DEB vendor replacement
make integration-test-rpm-vendor          # RPM vendor replacement
```

The lifecycle targets cover categories 3, 4, and 5 in `packaging/tests/lifecycle/`.
The vendor targets cover category 6 in `packaging/tests/vendor/`.
The per-language E2E targets cover categories 7 and 8 in `packaging/tests/<language>/` (the declarative-configuration scenarios run in the DEB targets).

The upgrade scenarios install from a second local repository (`build/local-repo/{apt,rpm}-next`) that serves an injector built at `NEXT_VERSION` (defaults to `VERSION.1`) with a modified `default_env.conf`.
The modification is required because dpkg and rpm skip conffile-conflict handling entirely when the pristine contents are identical between versions.

The vendor scenarios install from a third local repository (`build/local-repo/{apt,rpm}-vendor`) that serves the mock `acme-java-autoinstrumentation` package built by `packaging/tests/vendor/mkvendor`.
The vendor repository is kept separate so the E2E suites never see two providers of the same virtual package.

## Priority order

1. **Package metadata validation** — fastest to implement, catches regressions in `--provides`/`--depends` early.
2. **Package contents validation** — fast, no containers.
3. **Post-install / pre-uninstall scripts** — validates the most critical lifecycle event.
4. **Install scenarios** — validates dependency resolution for all install patterns.
5. **Vendor replacement** — validates the design doc's core premise.
6. **Config file lifecycle** — most complex, multiple scenarios per format.
